
Dropout:

Dropout Layers: Added Dropout(0.2) after each GRU layer. This will randomly drop 20% of the units during training, helping to prevent the model from overfitting.

Embedding dimention

Embedding Dimension: Increased to 256 to allow richer representations of the lyrics vocabulary.
GRU Units: Increased the units in each GRU layer to 256 for more model capacity.

LR Scheduler

ReduceLROnPlateau: This callback reduces the learning rate by a factor of 0.5 if the loss hasnâ€™t improved for 2 consecutive epochs, with a minimum learning rate of 1e-5.
Callback Integration: The scheduler is included in the callbacks list when training the model, so it dynamically adjusts the learning rate based on the monitored loss metric.

Data Generator

LyricsDataGenerator Class: Loads data in chunks when using a generator, minimizing memory usage.
should_use_generator Function: Checks if the generator should be used based on file size or a flag.
train Function: Determines if the dataset should be loaded fully or in chunks based on use_generator.
